# DS Lifecycle Phase I Case Study

## What problems are facing the organization? 
### The needs are not being met and the potential is not being maximized of educators and students due to poor utilization of resources. 

## What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
### The recommended resource or intervention for a school district based on the collected data. They are trying to develop a class variable based solution because they are recommending a specific type of resource or intervention (qualitative).

## How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
### We will know if its working based on improved student performance, teacher satisfaction, and long term cost savings that can be measured through post implementation feedback that is looped into the ML model. 

## What other issues might the team be facing?
### Problems with data collection: the dataset is small, and there are nuances in responses that are leading to biases and inconsistencies, making the dataset hard to draw conclusions from. 
### Validation of system's effectiveness: is the model truly measuring what we need it to, is the model reliable?
### Ethics based issues: Biases in training data, over representation of certain district types

## How difficult is the data to gather?
### There may be biases and representation issues between school districts, possibility of select school districts dominating the percentage of responses, with others having less input based on the parameter of 1500 responses from 30 districts with no more than 100 from each. 

## Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
### The target variable is difficult to measure and break into smaller parts because it involves measuring the outcomes of student performance, teacher satisfaction, and cost savings; with the first two outcomes being extremely difficult to quantify or validate due to its subjective nature. While measures like standardized test scores and anecdotal feedback can help gauge an idea of these variables, it varies and can be misleading.

## What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
### I am willing to accept a moderate level of risk in the modelâ€™s accuracy because the first versions of the model may be less accurate due to data quality issues but with the implementation of recommendations from feedback, the model can continue to be refined, reducing the level of uncertainty.
